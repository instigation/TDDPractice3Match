# TDDPractice3Match
3-match game implemented in Unreal Engine 4 to practice TDD. Since this project is intended to prove a point that unit testing is feasible and meaningful in game development, only the core features of a 3-match game are implemented. This means features such as options, ads, menus are not implemented.
